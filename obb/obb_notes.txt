when: 

blacks: Total no. of black points
fp: bbox's appearing in results but not in GT
fn: bbox's appearing in GT but not in results
clserr: An overlapping bbox, which its result's class is different then GT's class
low_conf: An overlapping bbox (iou > 0.5), which its confidence is lower than threshold
low_iou: A non-overlapping bbox (iou < 0.5), which its confidence is higher than threshold
